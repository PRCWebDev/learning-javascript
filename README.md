### Learning JavaScript 🚀

**`from multiple resources`**

- So far, I recreated from [The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann:

  - 3 mini-projects / games (⚠️ _` please note that these are made for viewing ONLY on a laptop / desktop screen, they are not made responsive for mobile / tablet viewing`_ ⚠️):
    - 🌟 the [Guess My Number](https://guess-my-number-js-webdevprc.netlify.app/) game
    - 🌟 the [Modal Window](https://modal-window-js-webdevprc.netlify.app/) mini-project
    - 🌟 the [Pig Game](https://pig-game-js-webdevprc.netlify.app/)
  - 🚧 Work in Progress (WIP) on Jonas "Bankist" App

    \*All credit for these projects goes to Jonas Schmedtmann 🙏 I am just his student, learning and practicing from his awesome course 🔥
