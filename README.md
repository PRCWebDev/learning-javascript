  - 3 mini-projects / games - please note that these are made for viewing ONLY on a laptop / desktop screen, they are not made responsive for mobile / tablet viewing:
    - [x] the [Guess My Number](https://guess-my-number-js-webdevprc.netlify.app/) game
    - [x] the [Modal Window](https://modal-window-js-webdevprc.netlify.app/) mini-project
    - [x] the [Pig Game](https://pig-game-js-webdevprc.netlify.app/)
