    <h1>Coding Challenge #8</h1>
    <p>
      Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs! This time, let's use
      objects to implement the calculations! Remember: BMI = mass / height ** 2
      = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).
    </p>

    <p>Your tasks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name,
        mass, and height (Mark Miller and John Smith)
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a 'calcBMI' method on each object to calculate the BMI (the same
        method on both objects). Store the BMI value to a property, and also
        return it from the method.
      </li>
      <li>
        Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name
        and the respective BMI. Example: "John Smith's BMI (28.3) is higher than
        Mark Miller's (23.9)!"
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        TEST DATA: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg
        and is 1.95 m tall.
      </li>
    </ul>
