    <h1>Coding Challenge #10</h1>
    <h2>Data Structures and Modern Operators</h2>

    <p>
      We're building a football betting app! Suppose we get data from a web
      service about a certain game (below). In this challenge we're gonna work
      with the data.
    </p>

    <p>Your tasks:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and
        'players2')
      </li>
      <li>
        The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others
        are field players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk')
        with the goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the
        remaining 10 field players
      </li>
      <li>
        Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22
        players)
      </li>
      <li>
        During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So
        create a new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1
        players plus 'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'
      </li>
      <li>
        Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called
        'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')
      </li>
      <li>
        Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of
        player names (NOT an array) and prints each of them to the console,
        along with the number of goals that were scored in total (number of
        player names passed in)
      </li>
      <li>
        The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. Print to the console
        which team is more likely to win, WITHOUT using an if/else statement or
        the ternary operator.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
      <li>
        TEST DATA FOR 6: Use players 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski' and
        'Kimmich'. Then, call the function again with players from game.scored
      </li>
    </ul>
