    <h1>Coding Challenge #9</h1>

    <p>
      Let's improve Steven's tip calculator even more, this time using loops!
    </p>

    <p>Your tasks:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create an array 'bills' containing all 10 test bill values</li>
      <li>
        Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals ('tips' and 'totals')
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the 'calcTip' function we wrote before (no need to repeat) to
        calculate tips and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the
        bills array. Use a for loop to perform the 10 calculations!
      </li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
      <li>TEST DATA: 22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86 and 52</li>
      <li>
        HINT: Call calcTip in the loop and use the push method to add values to
        the tips and totals arrays
      </li>
      <li>
        BONUS: Write a function 'calcAverage' which takes an array called 'arr'
        as an argument. This function calculates the average of all numbers in
        the given array. This is a DIFFICULT challenge (we haven't done this
        before)! Here is how to solve it:
        <ol>
          <li>
            First, you will need to add up all values in the array. To do the
            addition, start by creating a variable 'sum' that starts at 0. Then
            loop over the array using a for loop. In each iteration, add the
            current value to the 'sum' variable. This way, by the end of the
            loop, you have all values added together
          </li>
          <li>
            To calculate the average, divide the sum you calculated before by
            the length of the array (because that's the number of elements)
          </li>
          <li>Call the function with the 'totals' array</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
