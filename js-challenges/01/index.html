    <h1>Coding Challenge #1</h1>

    <p>
      Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
      calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height *
      height) (mass in kg and height in meters).
    </p>

    <p>Your tasks:
      <ol>
        <li>Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables</li>
        <li>Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)</li>
        <li>Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing
      information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John</li>
      </ol>

    <p>Test data:
      <ul>
        <li>Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92
    kg and is 1.95 m tall.</li>
        <li>Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
