    <h1>Coding Challenge #4</h1>

    <p>
      Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes
      eating in a restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill
      value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
    </p>

    <p>Your tasks:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called
        'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement (If it's
        easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to
        convert it to a ternary operator!)
      </li>
      <li>
        Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and
        the final value (bill + tip). Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was
        41.25, and the total value 316.25'
      </li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
      <li>TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430</li>
      <li>
        HINT 1: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
      </li>
      <li>HINT 2: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300</li>
    </ul>
