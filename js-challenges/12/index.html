    <h1>Coding Challenge #12</h1>
    <h2>Data Structures and Modern Operators</h2>

    <p>
      Let's continue with our football betting app! This time, we have a map
      with a log of the events that happened during the game. The values are the
      events themselves, and the keys are the minutes in which each event
      happened (a football game has 90 minutes plus some extra time).
    </p>

    <p>Your tasks:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Create an array 'events' of the different game events that happened (no
        duplicates)
      </li>
      <li>
        After the game has finished, is was found that the yellow card from
        minute 64 was unfair. So remove this event from the game events log.
      </li>
      <li>
        Print the following string to the console: "An event happened, on
        average, every 9 minutes" (keep in mind that a game has 90 minutes)
      </li>
      <li>
        Loop over the events and log them to the console, marking whether it's
        in the first half or second half (after 45 min) of the game, like this:
        [FIRST HALF] 17: ⚽️ GOAL
      </li>
    </ol>
