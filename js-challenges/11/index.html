    <h2>Data Structures and Modern Operators</h2>

    <p>Let's continue with our football betting app!</p>

    <p>Your tasks:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Loop over the game.scored array and print each player name to the
        console, along with the goal number (Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski")
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a loop to calculate the average odd and log it to the console (We
        already studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't
        remember)
      </li>
      <li>
        Print the 3 odds to the console, but in a nice formatted way, exactly
        like this: Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33 Odd of draw: 3.25 Odd of
        victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5 Get the team names directly from the
        game object, don't hardcode them (except for "draw"). HINT: Note how the
        odds and the game objects have the same property names ðŸ˜‰
      </li>
      <li>
        BONUS: Create an object called 'scorers' which contains the names of the
        players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the value.
        In this game, it will look like this: { Gnarby: 1, Hummels: 1,
        Lewandowski: 2 }
      </li>
    </ol>
