    <h2>LECTURE: Functions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Write a function called 'describeCountry' which takes three parameters:
        'country', 'population' and 'capitalCity'. Based on this input, the
        function returns a string with this format: 'Finland has 6 million
        people and it's capital city is Helsinki'
      </li>
      <li>
        Call this function 3 times, with input data for 3 different countries.
        Store the returned values in 3 different variables, and log them to the
        console
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>LECTURE: Function Declarations vs. Expressions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function
        declaration called 'percentageOfWorld1' which receives a 'population'
        value, and returns the percentage of the world population that the given
        population represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so
        it's about 18.2% of the world population
      </li>
      <li>
        To calculate the percentage, divide the given 'population' value by 7900
        and then multiply by 100
      </li>
      <li>
        Call 'percentageOfWorld1' for 3 populations of countries of your choice,
        store the results into variables, and log them to the console
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called
        'percentageOfWorld2', and also call it with 3 country populations (can
        be the same populations)
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>LECTURE: Arrow Functions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Recreate the last assignment, but this time create an arrow function
        called 'percentageOfWorld3'
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>LECTURE: Functions Calling Other Functions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Create a function called 'describePopulation'. Use the function type you
        like the most. This function takes in two arguments: 'country' and
        'population', and returns a string like this: 'China has 1441 million
        people, which is about 18.2% of the world.'
      </li>
      <li>
        To calculate the percentage, 'describePopulation' call the
        'percentageOfWorld1' you created earlier
      </li>
      <li>
        Call 'describePopulation' with data for 3 countries of your choice
      </li>
    </ol>
